	<h1> Coffee Catata </h1>
	<p> The catch phrase for Coffee Cantata, "Coffee: Music in a Cup," captures creator Margaret's unpretentious approach to coffee connoisseurship. Her coffee reviews are cross-referenced by geographic origin and brew method. The precise details of the extraction process, like temperature and coffee-to-water ratio, are meticulously recorded so you can repeat the experience at home. Her tasting notes are vivid and delightful and they include serving thoughts, such as how the brew pairs with milk.


16 Margaret - a professional musician - brings finesse to the art of tasting: "... one sip of an Ethiopia Yirgacheffe and you will never mistake the flavor for a Sumatra, just like you would never mistake Mozart for Shostakovich </p>
